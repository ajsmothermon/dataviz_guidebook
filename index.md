# About this Guidebook

Thank you for checking out my data visualization guidebook. This is a brief collection of lessons and insights that I have gathered on data visualization in a short five-years in the data industry. It contains modules on: 

* Why Data Visualization? 
* Visualization Process & KPI Developement
* Structuring Dashboards
* How to Use Charts
* How to Use Colors
* Ethical Concerns in Data Visualization

# Why a Guidebook?

After five years of working primarily on data visualization projects, I started noticing a trend. There appeared to be plenty of good, centralized resources for learning the technical aspects of different data visualization tools (e.g., Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, etc.), but less information on how to best apply these tools to different business contexts. 

However, as I continued to research and read, I learned that these resources **do exist**, but they are scattered across different websites, books, and videos. My goal is to consolidate these resources, along with some on-the-job lessons I have learned, to provide a comprehensive guide that somebody can read and feel equipped to know how to build great data visualizations (or at least know where to find this information!).

# Let's Talk! 

See anything I missed? Have any feedback? Have a resource that I should read and include here? Please reach out. The amount of information on this topic is vast, and I would love to learn more from peers in my industry.
